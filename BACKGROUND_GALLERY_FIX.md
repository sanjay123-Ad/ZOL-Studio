# ✅ Background Gallery Fullscreen Error - FIXED

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The error `Uncaught ReferenceError: fullscreenImage is not defined` occurred because:

- The `BackgroundGalleryPage` component was using `fullscreenImage` state and `setFullscreenImage` function
- But the state was **never declared** in the component
- The `closedViaBackButton` ref was also missing

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

Added the missing state and ref declarations to `pages/BackgroundGalleryPage.tsx`:

```typescript
const [fullscreenImage, setFullscreenImage] = useState<string | null>(null);
const closedViaBackButton = useRef<boolean>(false);
```

## 📝 **What Was Fixed**

- ✅ Added `fullscreenImage` state declaration
- ✅ Added `closedViaBackButton` ref declaration
- ✅ All existing code that uses these variables now works correctly

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   git add pages/BackgroundGalleryPage.tsx
   git commit -m "Fix missing fullscreenImage state in BackgroundGalleryPage"
   git push
   ```

2. **Test the Background Gallery:**
   - Go to Style Scene feature
   - Generate a pose
   - Click "Change Background" button
   - Should now open the background gallery without errors
   - Click on any image to view in fullscreen
   - Fullscreen modal should work correctly

## 📋 **Additional Notes**

The CSS 404 error (`index.css` not found) is a separate deployment issue:
- This typically happens when static assets aren't being served correctly
- Vercel should automatically serve built assets from `dist/client/`
- If the CSS error persists after deployment, check:
  - Build output directory in `vercel.json`
  - Static asset serving configuration
  - Build process completion

**Status:** ✅ Code fix complete - ready to deploy!
