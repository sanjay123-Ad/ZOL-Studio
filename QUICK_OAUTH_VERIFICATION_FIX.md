## 🎯 3 Issues to Fix

You have **3 verification issues**. Here's how to fix them quickly:

---

## ✅ Issue 1: Domain Ownership (15 minutes)

### Status:
- ✅ Verification file exists: `googleacdd945e88fc2488.html` in `public/` folder
- ❌ But not verified in Google Search Console

### Quick Fix:

1. **Go to Google Search Console:**
   ```
   https://search.google.com/search-console
   ```

2. **Add Property (if not already added):**
   - Click "Add Property"
   - Select "URL prefix"
   - Enter: `https://zolstudio.com`
   - Click "Continue"

3. **Verify with HTML File:**
   - Select "HTML file" verification method
   - Since file already exists, just click "Verify"
   - OR re-download the file and make sure it's accessible at:
     ```
     https://zolstudio.com/googleacdd945e88fc2488.html
     ```
   - Click "Verify" button
   - Should show "Ownership verified" ✅

4. **Wait 1-2 hours** for Google Cloud to sync

## ✅ Issue 2: Privacy Policy Link (Already Fixed! ✅)

### Status:
- ✅ Privacy Policy link **EXISTS** in footer (line 1069-1072 of LandingPage.tsx)
- ✅ Links to: `/privacy-policy`
- ⚠️ Google might not detect it yet (will fix after domain verification)

### What to Do:
- **Nothing!** The link already exists ✅
- After domain verification, Google will be able to detect it
- If still showing as error after verification, we'll investigate further

## ⚠️ Issue 3: App Name Mismatch (IMPORTANT!)

### Problem:
- **OAuth Consent Screen:** "Zol Studio AI" (capital Z, lowercase ol)
- **Homepage:** "ZOL Studio AI" (ALL CAPS ZOL)
- **They don't match exactly!**

### Quick Fix Options:

#### Option A: Change OAuth to Match Homepage (Recommended)

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
   - OAuth consent screen → Branding

2. **Change App Name:**
   - Find "App name" field
   - Change from: `Zol Studio AI`
   - Change to: `ZOL Studio AI` (all caps ZOL)

3. **Save changes**

#### Option B: Change Homepage to Match OAuth (Not Recommended)

This would require changing all instances of "ZOL Studio AI" to "Zol Studio AI" throughout your site, which is more work.

**Recommendation:** Use Option A - Change OAuth name to match your website.
