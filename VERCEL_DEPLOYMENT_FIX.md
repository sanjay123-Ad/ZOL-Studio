# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Fix - Static Assets Issue

## 🐛 **Problem**

After deploying to Vercel, you're seeing:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script 
but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html"
```

**Root Cause:** The `vercel.json` was routing ALL requests (including static JS files) to `/api/server`, which only returns HTML.

---

## ✅ **Solution**

Updated `vercel.json` to:
1. ✅ Serve static files directly (JS, CSS, images, etc.)
2. ✅ Route API requests to API handlers
3. ✅ Route all other requests to `/api/server` for SSR

---

## 📝 **Updated vercel.json**

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/client",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*\\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|ico|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|json|map))",
      "destination": "/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/server"
    }
  ],
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/credits/monthly-reset",
      "schedule": "0 0 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔍 **What Changed**

### **Before (Broken):**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/server"
    }
  ]
}
```
❌ **Problem:** All requests (including `index-0QGNIYNW.js`) went to `/api/server` → Got HTML instead of JS

### **After (Fixed):**
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*\\.(js|css|...))",
      "destination": "/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/api/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/$1"
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/api/server"
    }
  ]
}
```
✅ **Solution:** 
- Static files (`.js`, `.css`, etc.) → Served directly from `dist/client`
- API routes (`/api/*`) → Handled by API functions
- Everything else → SSR via `/api/server`

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Commit the fix:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json
   git commit -m "Fix: Exclude static assets from SSR rewrite in vercel.json"
   git push
   ```

2. **Vercel will auto-deploy:**
   - Wait for deployment to complete
   - Check deployment logs

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Visit your Vercel URL
   - Check browser console (should see no errors)
   - Verify JS files load correctly

---

## ⚙️ **Vercel Build Settings**

Make sure these are set in Vercel Dashboard:

**Build & Development Settings:**
- **Build Command:** `npm run build`
- **Output Directory:** `dist/client`
- **Install Command:** `npm install`
- **Node Version:** 20.x

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

After redeploy:

1. **Check Network Tab:**
   - Open DevTools → Network
   - Reload page
   - Check `index-*.js` file
   - **Expected:** Content-Type: `application/javascript`
   - **Before:** Content-Type: `text/html` ❌

2. **Check Console:**
   - Should see no module loading errors
   - App should load normally

3. **Check Page:**
   - App should render correctly
   - No white screen

---

## 📋 **Additional Fixes**

### **1. Tailwind CSS Warning**

The warning about `cdn.tailwindcss.com` is because you're using the CDN in production.

**Fix:** Install Tailwind CSS properly:
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then update `index.html` to remove the CDN script and use the compiled CSS.

**For now:** This is just a warning, not breaking. You can fix it later.

---

## ✅ **Summary**

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Static assets now served correctly
- ✅ JS files load with correct MIME type
- ✅ API routes work correctly
- ✅ SSR still works for pages

**Next:**
1. Commit and push `vercel.json`
2. Wait for auto-deployment
3. Test the deployed site
4. (Optional) Fix Tailwind CSS warning

**Your deployment should work now!** 🎉
