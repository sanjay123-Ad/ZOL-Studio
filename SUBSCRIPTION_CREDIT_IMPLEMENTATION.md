# ZOLA AI Subscription & Credit System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Applied (Cursor Model)

### 1. **Webhook Handler Updated** (`server.ts`)

**What Changed:**
- ✅ Detects plan changes vs renewals automatically
- ✅ Resets credits on plan changes (no rollover)
- ✅ Keeps rollover only for renewals (same plan)

**Logic Flow:**
```typescript
if (isPlanChange) {
  // Reset credits - discard old, activate new
  newTotalCredits = credits; // No rollover
} else if (isRenewal) {
  // Allow rollover of unused credits
  newTotalCredits = credits + rolloverCredits;
}
```

### 2. **Credit Service Updated** (`services/creditService.ts`)

**New Function Added:**
- ✅ `resetCredits()` - For plan changes (Cursor Model)
- ✅ `allocateCredits()` - Updated to detect renewals vs plan changes

**Key Behavior:**
- Plan change → Calls `resetCredits()` (discards old credits)
- Renewal → Calls `allocateCredits()` (allows rollover)

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **Scenario 1: Upgrade (Basic → Pro)**

**Before (OLD):**
```
User has: Basic Monthly, 120 credits remaining
Upgrade to: Pro Monthly
Result: 120 (rollover) + 750 (new) = 870 credits ❌ WRONG
```

**After (NEW - Cursor Model):**
```
User has: Basic Monthly, 120 credits remaining
Upgrade to: Pro Monthly
Result: 750 credits (old 120 discarded) ✅ CORRECT
```

### **Scenario 2: Renewal (Pro → Pro)**

**Before (OLD):**
```
User has: Pro Monthly, 200 credits remaining
Renewal: Pro Monthly
Result: 200 (rollover) + 750 (new) = 950 credits ✅ CORRECT (unchanged)
```

**After (NEW):**
```
User has: Pro Monthly, 200 credits remaining
Renewal: Pro Monthly
Result: 200 (rollover) + 750 (new) = 950 credits ✅ CORRECT (unchanged)
```

### **Scenario 3: Monthly → Annual**

**Before (OLD):**
```
User has: Basic Monthly, 50 credits remaining
Switch to: Basic Annual
Result: 50 (rollover) + 250 (new) = 300 credits ❌ WRONG
```

**After (NEW - Cursor Model):**
```
User has: Basic Monthly, 50 credits remaining
Switch to: Basic Annual
Result: 250 credits (old 50 discarded, fresh start) ✅ CORRECT
```

## 🗄️ Supabase Policies

### ✅ **No Changes Required**

**Why:**
- Webhook handler uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Service role key bypasses RLS policies
- Existing policies are correct for user-facing operations

**Current Policies (Already Correct):**
- ✅ Users can view their own profile
- ✅ Users can update their own profile
- ✅ Users can insert their own profile
- ✅ Users can delete their own profile

**Service Role Access:**
- ✅ Webhook handler uses service role (bypasses RLS)
- ✅ Can update any profile for subscription changes
- ✅ No additional policies needed

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Plan Upgrade
1. User has Basic Monthly with 100 credits remaining
2. Upgrade to Pro Monthly
3. **Expected:** 750 credits (old 100 discarded)
4. **Verify:** `total_credits = 750`, `used_credits = 0`

### Test 2: Plan Renewal
1. User has Pro Monthly with 200 credits remaining
2. Renew Pro Monthly (same plan)
3. **Expected:** 950 credits (200 rollover + 750 new)
4. **Verify:** `total_credits = 950`, `used_credits = 0`

### Test 3: Monthly → Annual
1. User has Basic Monthly with 50 credits remaining
2. Switch to Basic Annual
3. **Expected:** 250 credits (old 50 discarded)
4. **Verify:** `total_credits = 250`, `used_credits = 0`

### Test 4: Downgrade
1. User has Pro Monthly with 500 credits remaining
2. Downgrade to Basic Monthly
3. **Expected:** 250 credits (old 500 discarded)
4. **Verify:** `total_credits = 250`, `used_credits = 0`

## 📝 Code Changes Summary

### **File: `server.ts`**
- ✅ Added plan change detection logic
- ✅ Separated plan change vs renewal handling
- ✅ Updated credit allocation to reset on plan changes

### **File: `services/creditService.ts`**
- ✅ Added `resetCredits()` function for plan changes
- ✅ Updated `allocateCredits()` to detect renewals
- ✅ Added logging for clarity

---

## 🎯 Key Principles Applied

✅ **Plan change = capacity reset**
✅ **Credits ≠ money**
✅ **Credits = AI compute allowance**
✅ **No credit carry-forward on upgrades**
✅ **Rollover only for renewals (same plan)**
✅ **Lemon Squeezy handles proration**
✅ **ZOLA AI handles credits & logic**

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test webhook scenarios** with Lemon Squeezy test mode
2. **Monitor logs** to verify plan change detection
3. **Update user messaging** (if needed) to explain credit reset on upgrades
4. **Monitor for edge cases** in production

---

## 📌 Important Notes

- **Service Role Key Required:** Webhook handler must use service role key
- **No RLS Changes Needed:** Service role bypasses RLS automatically
- **Logging Added:** Check console logs to verify plan change detection
- **Backward Compatible:** Existing renewals still work with rollover

---

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The subscription and credit system now follows the **Cursor Model**:
- Clean upgrades (no credit hoarding)
- Fair renewals (rollover allowed)
- Simple accounting
- Industry standard behavior

**No Supabase policy changes required** - existing setup is correct.
