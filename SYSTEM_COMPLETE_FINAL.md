## 📊 **Monitoring Your System**

### **Daily Checks (First Week):**
1. **GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to GitHub → Actions
   - Verify daily runs are happening
   - Check for any failures

2. **Vercel Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel → Your Project → Logs
   - Check for any errors
   - Monitor endpoint calls

### **Weekly Checks:**
1. **Review Credit Resets:**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs
   - Verify resets are happening correctly
   - Check user credits in Supabase

2. **Monitor Subscriptions:**
   - Verify webhooks are working
   - Check new subscriptions
   - Ensure credits are allocated correctly

## 🧪 **Optional: Test with Real Users**

When you have users with annual plans:

1. **Create a Test User:**
   - Sign up a test account
   - Subscribe to Basic Annual plan

2. **Manually Set Reset Date (For Testing):**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET next_credit_reset_at = NOW()
   WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

3. **Run Workflow Manually:**
   - Go to GitHub → Actions
   - Run "Monthly Credit Reset" workflow
   - Check response - should show `"reset": 1`

4. **Verify in Supabase:**
   - Check user's credits were reset
   - Check `next_credit_reset_at` updated to next month
