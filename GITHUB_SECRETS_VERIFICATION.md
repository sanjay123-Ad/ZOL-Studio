## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Workflow Fails:**

#### **Error: "401 Unauthorized"**
- **Problem:** `CREDIT_RESET_SECRET` doesn't match Vercel
- **Fix:**

  2. Make sure `CREDIT_RESET_SECRET` in Vercel matches GitHub secret
  3. Update GitHub secret if needed

#### **Error: "404 Not Found"**
- **Problem:** URL is wrong or endpoint doesn't exist
- **Fix:**
  1. Verify Vercel domain: `https://zol-studio.vercel.app`
  2. Check endpoint exists: `/api/credits/monthly-reset`
  3. Update `VERCEL_CREDIT_RESET_URL` secret if domain changed

#### **Error: "Workflow not found"**
- **Problem:** Workflow file not committed
- **Fix:**
  1. Make sure `.github/workflows/monthly-credit-reset.yml` exists
  2. Commit and push it
  3. Refresh GitHub Actions page
