   - Click **"Delete"** button next to it
   - Confirm deletion

3. **Then Add the New A Record:**
   - Click **"Add Record"** again
   - Type: **A**
   - Name: `@`
   - Value: `216.198.79.1`
   - TTL: `3600`
   - Click **"Save"**

### **Option 2: Edit Existing Record (Alternative)**

### **Step 1: Cancel the Modal**

### **Step 2: Delete Old A Record**

## 📋 **Why This Matters**

**Having Two A Records:**
- ❌ Can cause website to be inaccessible
- ❌ DNS will randomly choose between them
- ❌ Can cause connection issues

**Having One A Record (Correct):**
- ✅ Website works reliably
- ✅ Points to correct Vercel server
- ✅ No conflicts

---

## ✅ **After Fixing**

You should have:
- ✅ **One A Record:** `@` → `216.198.79.1` (TTL: 3600)
- ✅ **One CNAME Record:** `www` → `1a17048618b8cd0b.vercel-dns-017.com.` (TTL: 3600)

**That's it!** No duplicates.

---

## 🎯 **Summary**

**What to Do:**
1. ✅ Click **"Cancel"** (don't confirm)
2. ✅ **Delete** the old A record (`84.32.84.32`)
3. ✅ **Add** the new A record (`216.198.79.1`)
4. ✅ Wait for DNS propagation

**Don't have two A records!** Delete the old one first. 🎉
