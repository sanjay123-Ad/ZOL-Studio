## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Connect Your Custom Domain (If You Have One)**

If you have a domain from Hostinger:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Select your project: **zol-studio-p5v9**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Domains**

2. **Add Your Domain:**
   - Click **Add Domain**
   - Enter: `yourdomain.com` (or `www.yourdomain.com`)

3. **Get DNS Records:**
   - Vercel will show DNS records to add
   - Copy the A and CNAME records

4. **Add DNS in Hostinger:**
   - Log in to Hostinger
   - Go to **Domains** → Your Domain → **DNS / Nameservers**
   - Add the DNS records from Vercel
   - Wait 5-30 minutes for propagation

5. **Update GitHub Secret (If Domain Changed):**
   - If you use custom domain, update `VERCEL_CREDIT_RESET_URL`:
   - New value: `https://yourdomain.com/api/credits/monthly-reset`

---

### **Step 2: Test with Real Users (Optional but Recommended)**

When you have users with annual plans, test the reset:

1. **Create a Test User:**
   - Sign up a test account
   - Subscribe to Basic Annual plan

2. **Manually Set Reset Date (For Testing):**
   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET next_credit_reset_at = NOW()
   WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

3. **Run Workflow Manually:**
   - Go to GitHub → Actions
   - Run "Monthly Credit Reset" workflow
   - Check response - should show `"reset": 1`

4. **Verify in Supabase:**
   - Check user's credits were reset
   - Check `next_credit_reset_at` updated to next month

---

### **Step 3: Monitor Your System**

**Daily Checks (First Week):**
- ✅ Check GitHub Actions - verify daily runs are happening
- ✅ Check Vercel logs - look for any errors
- ✅ Monitor user subscriptions - ensure webhooks are working

**Weekly Checks:**
- ✅ Review credit reset logs
- ✅ Check for any failed workflows
- ✅ Verify user credits are resetting correctly

---

## 🎯 **Production Readiness Checklist**

### **Environment Variables:**
- [x] ✅ All variables added to Vercel
- [x] ✅ GitHub secrets configured
- [ ] ⚠️ Update `LEMONSQUEEZY_SUCCESS_URL` to production domain (if using custom domain)

### **Security:**
- [x] ✅ `CREDIT_RESET_SECRET` is set
- [x] ✅ Secrets are encrypted
- [x] ✅ Endpoint requires authentication

### **Monitoring:**

## 📊 **What Happens Automatically Now**

### **Daily (Midnight UTC):**
- ✅ GitHub Actions runs automatically
- ✅ Calls `/api/credits/monthly-reset` endpoint
- ✅ Resets credits for users whose `next_credit_reset_at` is today
- ✅ Updates `next_credit_reset_at` to next month

### **When Users Subscribe:**
- ✅ Webhook receives subscription event
- ✅ Credits allocated (monthly amount)
- ✅ `next_credit_reset_at` set to 1 month from now
- ✅ Credits expire in 1 month

### **When Users Upgrade/Downgrade:**
- ✅ Webhook detects plan change
- ✅ Credits reset to new plan amount
- ✅ `next_credit_reset_at` updated

---

## 🔧 **Optional Enhancements**

### **1. Set Up Error Alerts (Optional)**
- Configure GitHub Actions to send email on failure
- Set up Vercel alerts for function errors

### **2. Add Monitoring Dashboard (Optional)**
- Track credit reset statistics
- Monitor user subscription health

### **3. Add Logging (Optional)**
- Log all credit resets to a database
- Create audit trail

---

## 📝 **Important Notes**

### **Cron Schedule:**
- **Runs:** Daily at midnight UTC
- **Timezone:** UTC (not your local time)
- **Manual Trigger:** Available anytime from GitHub Actions

### **Credit Reset Logic:**
- Only resets users with `next_credit_reset_at` = today
- Allows rollover of unused credits
- Works for both monthly and annual plans

### **Troubleshooting:**
- If workflow fails → Check GitHub Actions logs
- If endpoint errors → Check Vercel function logs
- If credits don't reset → Check `next_credit_reset_at` dates in Supabase
