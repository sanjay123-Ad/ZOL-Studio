# Webhook Credit Allocation Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Billing Period Detection Fixed** ✅

**Problem:**
- Basic Monthly (variant 1124106) was incorrectly detected as "annual"
- Logic was checking if renewal date > 30 days, which incorrectly flagged monthly subscriptions

**Solution:**
- Created `getBillingPeriodFromVariantId()` function
- Directly checks variant ID against monthly/annual variant IDs from environment variables
- Most accurate method - no guessing based on dates

**Code:**
```typescript
function getBillingPeriodFromVariantId(variantId: string): 'monthly' | 'annual' | null {
  // Checks variant ID directly against monthly/annual variant IDs
  // Returns 'monthly' or 'annual' based on exact match
}
```

### 2. **Double Credit Allocation Fixed** ✅

**Problem:**
- `subscription_updated` event was allocating credits again
- Caused credits to double (250 + 250 = 500)

**Solution:**
- Only allocate credits on `subscription_created` or `subscription_payment_success`
- `subscription_updated` now only updates metadata (plan status, billing period, etc.)
- Prevents duplicate credit allocation

**Code:**
```typescript
const shouldAllocateCredits = 
  eventName === 'subscription_created' || 
  eventName === 'subscription_payment_success';

if (shouldAllocateCredits && planStatus === 'active' && ...) {
  // Allocate credits
} else {
  // Only update metadata
}
```

### 3. **Signup Credits Preservation** ✅

**Problem:**
- Signup credits (10 credits) were being discarded on plan activation
- User loses their free trial credits when upgrading

**Solution:**
- Preserve signup credits (up to 10) when activating first paid plan
- Signup credits are preserved if:
  - They haven't expired
  - They haven't been fully used
  - User is activating their first paid subscription

**Code:**
```typescript
if (isFirstTimePaid) {
  // Preserve signup credits (up to 10) if valid
  if (signup_bonus_given && remainingCredits > 0 && !expired) {
    signupCreditsPreserved = Math.min(remainingCredits, 10);
  }
  newTotalCredits = planCredits + signupCreditsPreserved;
}
```

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **Scenario 1: New User Activates Basic Monthly**

**Before (WRONG):**
```
User has: 10 signup credits
Activate Basic Monthly
Result: 250 credits (signup credits discarded) ❌
Billing Period: annual (wrong!) ❌
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```
User has: 10 signup credits
Activate Basic Monthly
Result: 260 credits (250 plan + 10 signup preserved) ✅
Billing Period: monthly ✅
```

---

### **Scenario 2: subscription_updated Event**

**Before (WRONG):**
```
subscription_created → Allocates 250 credits
subscription_updated → Allocates 250 credits again
Total: 500 credits ❌
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```
subscription_created → Allocates 250 credits ✅
subscription_updated → Only updates metadata ✅
Total: 250 credits ✅
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Plan Change (Basic → Pro)**

**Before (WRONG):**
```
User has: Basic Monthly, 10 signup + 100 remaining = 110 credits
Upgrade to Pro Monthly
Result: 750 credits (all old credits discarded) ❌
```

**After (CORRECT):**
```
User has: Basic Monthly, 10 signup + 100 remaining = 110 credits
Upgrade to Pro Monthly
Result: 760 credits (750 plan + 10 signup preserved) ✅
```
