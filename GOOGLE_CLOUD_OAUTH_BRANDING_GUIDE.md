## 🎨 Logo Requirements for Google OAuth

### Critical Logo Specifications:

Based on Google's requirements shown in your console:

1. **File Size:** 
   - ✅ Maximum: **1MB**
   - ⚠️ Your file should be under 1MB

3. **Dimensions:**
   - ✅ Recommended: **120x120 pixels** (square)
   - ⚠️ Your file is `logo_192x192.png` - This is fine! (larger is okay, Google will resize)

4. **Aspect Ratio:**
   - ✅ Must be **square** (1:1 ratio)
   - ✅ Your 192x192 is square - Perfect!

### Logo Best Practices:

## 📋 Step-by-Step: What You Should Do

### Step 1: Prepare Your Logo File ✅

**Requirements Checklist:**
- [ ] Logo is **square** (1:1 aspect ratio)
- [ ] Dimensions: **120x120 pixels** (or larger, like 192x192)
- [ ] File size: **Under 1MB**
- [ ] Format: **PNG, JPG, or BMP**
- [ ] Logo is clear and recognizable

**Your Current Setup:**
- ✅ Using `logo_192x192.png` - Good choice!
- ⚠️ Verify file size is under 1MB
- ⚠️ Ensure it's a clear, professional logo

### Step 2: Upload Logo in Google Cloud Console

1. **Go to Branding Page:**
   - Navigate to: Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen → Branding

2. **Upload Logo:**
   - Click "Browse" button
   - Select your `logo_192x192.png` file
   - Wait for upload to complete
   - Verify preview looks correct

3. **Save Changes:**
   - Click "Save" at the bottom of the page
   - Wait for confirmation

### Step 3: Verify App Details

**App Name:**
- ✅ "ZOL Studio AI" - This is correct!
- ⚠️ Should match your brand name exactly

**User Support Email:**
- ✅ `nafeesdeen3@gmail.com` - Set correctly
- ⚠️ Use a professional email (consider using support@zolstudio.com if possible)
- ✅ Must be a valid email you can access

### Step 4: Configure App Domain (If Not Done)

From your screenshot, I see these fields should be filled:

1. **Application home page:**
   ```
   https://zolstudio.com
   ```

2. **Application privacy policy link:**
   ```
   https://zolstudio.com/privacy-policy
   ```

3. **Application terms of service link:**
   ```
   https://zolstudio.com/terms-and-conditions
   ```

**Why These Matter:**
- Users see these links on the consent screen
- Required for app verification (if you publish publicly)
- Builds trust with users

### Step 5: Verify Authorized Domains ✅

Your authorized domains look good:
- ✅ `zolstudio.com` - Your main domain
- ✅ `wtxwgkiiwibgfnpfkckx.supabase.co` - Supabase domain
- ✅ `google.com` - Standard
- ✅ Other deployment domains

**Important Notes:**
- All domains used in OAuth must be authorized
- You can add more if needed with "+ Add domain"
- Maximum limit applies (check Google's documentation)
